Universities are becoming the basis of scientific and technological clusters, driving the growth of cities and regions. The mission of the university has long gone beyond the limits of teaching or presenting the knowledge by means of its translation, as it was in the Middle Ages. <br><br> Therefore, a natural question arises: how can we sort out and choose the key aspects of the university's activity among the variety of the others and reflect them in the ranking methodology? It is worth taking into account that there is no ranking to be able to cover all aspects of the university's activities since each university has its own unique features. Not to mention that some areas of activity are more amenable to quantitative accounting (scientific activity), the others are less (educational activities). <br><br> After a careful analysis of all possible areas of activity, we chose two main and two auxiliary directions of the university's assessment. The main directions constitute the meaning of the institution's activity and its basis. The auxiliary ones are supposed to measure additional, background aspects of activities. <br><br>"
